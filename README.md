# CST435-Assignment-2
This repository contains a Python-based parallel image processing system. The project implements an image processing pipeline using two parallel programming paradigms: multiprocessing and concurrent.futures. Performance is evaluated through execution time, speedup, and efficiency analysis using a subset of the Food-101 dataset.
